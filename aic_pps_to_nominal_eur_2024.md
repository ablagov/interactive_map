# AIC per Capita: PPS vs Nominal EUR (2024)

**Converting Purchasing Power Standards to Actual Euros Spent**

---

## Methodology

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **PPS (Purchasing Power Standard)** | Artificial currency that equalizes purchasing power across countries. €1 PPS buys the same basket of goods anywhere. |
| **PLI (Price Level Index)** | Shows how expensive a country is relative to EU average (EU27=100). |
| **Nominal EUR** | Actual euros spent/earned in each country. |

**Conversion Formula:**
```
Nominal EUR = PPS × (PLI / 100)
```

**Example - Bulgaria:**
- AIC per capita: €20,572 PPS
- Price Level Index: 60
- Nominal EUR: €20,572 × 0.60 = **€12,343/year**

This means Bulgarians actually spend €12,343/year in nominal terms, but due to lower prices, this buys €20,572 worth of goods at EU average prices.

## Bulgaria Deep Dive

### The Two Perspectives

| Metric | PPS View | Nominal View |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Annual consumption | €20,572 | €12,343 |
| Monthly consumption | €1,714 | €1,029 |
| vs EU average | 74% | 44% |
| Interpretation | Real purchasing power | Actual euros spent |

### What This Means

**In PPS terms (€20,572/year):**
- A Bulgarian can buy 74% of what an average EU citizen can buy
- This accounts for the fact that €1 goes further in Bulgaria
- Better measure of actual living standards

**In Nominal EUR (€12,343/year):**
- Bulgarians actually spend €12,343/year in current prices
- This is only 44% of EU average spending in nominal terms
- But prices are 40% lower, so this buys more

### Price Level Impact

Bulgaria's PLI of 60 means:
- Prices are **40% below** EU average
- €100 in Bulgaria buys what €167 buys at EU prices
- This is why nominal figures understate Bulgarian welfare

## Key Comparisons

### Bulgaria vs Germany

| Metric | Bulgaria | Germany | Ratio |
|--------|----------|---------|-------|
| AIC (PPS) | €20,572 | €32,804 | 63% |
| AIC (Nominal) | €12,343 | €34,444 | 36% |
| Price Level | 60 | 105 | 57% |

The **nominal gap looks 2.8x** (€12,343 vs €34,444), but the **real gap is only 1.6x** (€20,572 vs €32,804) because German prices are 75% higher than Bulgarian prices.

### Bulgaria vs Romania

| Metric | Bulgaria | Romania | Difference |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| AIC (PPS) | €20,572 | €24,464 | Romania +19% |
| AIC (Nominal) | €12,343 | €13,700 | Romania +11% |
| Price Level | 60 | 56 | Romania 7% cheaper |

Romania has pulled ahead in real welfare terms, but their prices are even lower, so the nominal gap is smaller.

### Nordics vs Balkans

| Country | AIC (PPS) | AIC (Nominal) | PLI |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| Denmark | €30,024 | €42,934 | 143 |
| Bulgaria | €20,572 | €12,343 | 60 |
| **Ratio** | **1.5x** | **3.5x** | **2.4x** |

The nominal gap (3.5x) dramatically overstates the real welfare difference (1.5x) because Danish prices are 2.4x higher.

## Interpretation Guide

### When to Use PPS
- Comparing **actual living standards** between countries
- Understanding **real purchasing power**
- Policy analysis (EU cohesion funds use PPS)
- Answering: "How much can people afford to consume?"

### When to Use Nominal EUR
- Comparing **wages and salaries** across borders
- Understanding **cost competitiveness**
- Business decisions (labor costs, pricing)
- Answering: "How much money changes hands?"

### The Complete Picture

| Country | Nominal € | × | Price Multiplier | = | Real Welfare (PPS) |
|---------|-----------|---|------------------|---|-------------------|
| Bulgaria | €12,343 | × | 1.67 (100/60) | = | €20,572 |
| Germany | €34,444 | × | 0.95 (100/105) | = | €32,804 |
| Romania | €13,700 | × | 1.79 (100/56) | = | €24,464 |
